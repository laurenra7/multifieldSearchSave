## MultifieldSearchSave
Mendix widget to search and filter multiple attributes (fields) 
of an associated Mendix DataGrid or ListView that can also save 
current search parameters for re-use.

This allows saving a combination of search filters to be used as a 
"most recently used" search when the user returns to the page or 
saved as a favorite filter combination that can retrieved from a list 
so it can be quickly reapplied.

Based on the GridSearch widget of the 
[GridSearch](https://github.com/tieniber/GridSearch) collection of 
Mendix widgets. The GridSearch widgets were built with the older 
[DoJo](https://dojotoolkit.org/) toolkit. This one is built with the newer 
[React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library.
